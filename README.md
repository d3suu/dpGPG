d3s's Physical GPG - a toolchain for making physical gpg private key

## Idea:
You know that feel when you are working on your laptop in McDonald or whatever and you are reading mails from your friends who are into encryption, so they send you GPG-encrypted emails, and suddenly some guy tries to steal your laptop with your private GPG key? No? Me too.

Idea behind dpGPG is that you can work with your private GPG key only when there is connected special pendrive into one of USB ports of your laptop/PC. Also you can work with your GPG-encrypted files on pendrive buffer so when you unplug the pendrive, there is no decrypted data on your laptop.

## Requirements:
### Hardware:
- Literally any GNU/Linux distribution which runs systemd-like daemons or something (idk im still learning)
- ANY pendrive/sdcard/whatever (can be even 8MB if you want only to store GPG key on it)
- Time for reading all this stuff made by some amateur (me lol)

### Software:
- g++
- make
