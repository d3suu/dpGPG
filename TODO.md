# dpGPG

TODO:
- Cut code into libraries (like mbr.cpp, highlevel.cpp, or something)
- Make code *prettier*
- Do something with these system() things, check if command goes right, and stuff
- Make protection questions ("Are you sure about that device" etc)
- Don't kill another pendrive
- Maybe comment a bit more the code in dense places
- Make partition_table_gen() more dynamic (as in change the input arguments and function to calculate space for encryption buffer and secring)
